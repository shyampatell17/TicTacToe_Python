This is pure console game which would require you to answer the questions after it after every step.

I have made this thinking as if two players are sitting together and wanted to play "X" and "O", So they both would have to pass the 
laptop to each other for their turns as the system will decide who will go first and second.

Everything else is self-explanitory, feel free to ask any questions at shyampatel1707@gmail.com

ENJOY!!!
